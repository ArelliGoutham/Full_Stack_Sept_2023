/**
 *   What is state in React?
 *     -> A state is a built-in react object that is used to contain data about the component.
 *     -> A component's state can change over the time, 
 *        whenever the state is going to change then the component has to re-render.
 * 
 *     -> How to respond events in react and update the UI?
 *        - What is an event? -> Remember in DOM API-> just an action like clicking the button, enter the value in input field.

 *     -> What is hook in react?
          - a hook is function that allows you to use the state in a functional component.
          - useState() -> is a built-in hook that manages the state of a functional component.
                       -> useState doesnâ€™t return just a variable, t returns an array, where the first element is the state variable 
                          and the second element is a function to update the value of the variable.
          - There are 2 kinds of hooks available in React:
            1. built-in hooks: useState(), useEffect(), useMemo(), useCallack() etc
            2. custom hooks -> useFetch() - user defined hooks can also be created via prefix "use"
