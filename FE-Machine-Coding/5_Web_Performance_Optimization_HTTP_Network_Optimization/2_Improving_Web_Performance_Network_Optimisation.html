    Web Performance Optimization:
       -> Rendering optimization techniques: (HTML and CSS)
       -----------------------------------------

        1. While writing your HTML code:
            1.1. Avoid unecessary elements/tags
            1.2. Try to reduce the DOM Size.
            1.3. validate HTML page. (https://validator.schema.org/)

        2. Image optimization:
            2.1. compress or optimise the images (either as your Design team or https://tinyjpg.com/)
            2.2. use responsive design to download the resources from the server based on devices are being used via end user.
            2.3. modern format of images webP or PNG.

        3. CSS and layout:
          3.1. use flexbox or grid layout.
          3.2. segregate the critical rendering CSS and put in a separate file or use in internal way of wrting the styles
          3.3. Minified your CSS file.
          3.4. Minified the HTML
          3.5. build RWD and use %, or em or rem units in CSS

        4. defer you non-critical CSS.
           - put at the end of your web page closed </body> tag

        5. Minimize the reflows and repaints:
           - use transform properties for the animations ot transitions

        JS optimisation Techniques:
        -----------------------------
          1. use defer or async attributes in script tags for JS files.
          2. minify the JS files.
          3. Intersection observer -> lazy loading of your images -> (Will the practical for FSP)
          4. use fragments 
          5. code clean -> How to avoid memory leakage problems.
          6. Use CDN -> for accessing the heavy assests -> images/SVG/GIF/videos/font families/ icons -> use AWS cloud front 
          7. use memoization 
          
        Network Optimisation techniques:
        ------------------------------ 
        1. minification (HTML, CSS, JS)
        2. code Splitting (HTML, CSS and JS)
        3. Compression: 
               -> reduces the size of data before transmission, saves the bandwidth of the netwrod and improves the speed.
               -> gzip must be enabled at infra level and at BE (devops team)
        4. caching: 
               -> caching stores copies of data or resources temporarily to speed up access and reduce the load on the servers.
        5. CDN: 
             -> Content Delivery Network: a distributed netword to store the copies of the web content.
             -> for accessing the heavy assests -> AWS cloud front(AWS CDN)
